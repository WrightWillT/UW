For instance, it could be the case that similar groups tend to get-along better and hence produce better quality work.  If that were the case, then having one-row-per-student with factors for personality (e.g. Big-5, MBTI), strengths/weaknesses, conflict-resolution style, interests, etc. would result in k-clusters of the most-similar students (at least along the dimensions of data gathered).\n",

A weather front might have features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and coordinates.  This is useful because being able to provide weather updates is more easily achieved when one can talk about weather fronts as systems (e.g. the warm air from Hawaii is heading in and about to cause storms as it meets the cool air from Alaska) instead of as highly-localized events where it's harder to understand the causality.\n",
