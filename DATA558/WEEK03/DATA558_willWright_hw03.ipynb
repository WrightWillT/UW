    "In this exercise, you will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run a nearest neighbors algorithm on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The goals of this exercise are:  \n",
    "&emsp;1. To teach you how to use AWS's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service (S3)  \n",

    "**Background:** The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has gathered data on many objects in the sky. The data set you will use in this assignment consists of (1) a “training” set of pho- tometric data on known astronomical objects; and (2) a “test” set of additional photometric data on more objects. Astronomers often need to determine which objects in a new data set are worth further examination because their telescope time is very limited. By finding the nearest neighbors in the training set to each object in the test set, they can tell whether the object is interesting or not. For example, if an object in the test set is closest to sun-like stars, then they might find that one very boring and not follow up on it.  \n",
